# About Rancho Santa Teresa Neighborhood Association

## Mission Statement

The Rancho Santa Teresa Neighborhood Association is dedicated to working with local government entities to improve and maintain the quality of life for the people who live, work, and play in the Rancho Santa Teresa neighborhood. We also strive to provide opportunities for neighbors to connect with each other, build mutual support systems, and enjoy our neighborhood together.

The Rancho Santa Teresa Neighborhood Association Committees play a crucial role in fulfilling our mission to improve and maintain the quality of life in our neighborhood. By clearly defining the purpose, roles, and duties of each committee, we empower residents to take an active part in shaping the future of our community.

## Difference from Rancho Santa Teresa Swim and Racquet Club

Please be aware that the Rancho Santa Teresa Neighborhood Association (“RSTNA”) and the [Rancho Santa Teresa Swim and Racquet Club](https://www.ranchosantateresa.org/) (“Club”) are two separate organizations. The management of the Club has a great deal of work and responsibility managing the clubhouse, swimming pool, etc. and making sure everything is insured and the bills are paid. They understandably feel that they are donating enough of their time to fulfill those duties and don’t want to undertake any efforts on external or political matters.

The raison d’etre of RSTNA is to protect the interests of ourselves and our neighbors, particularly in matters involving the city and county governments and the safety and wellbeing of our neighborhood.

The management of the Club is understandably insistent that RSTNA makes every effort to make it clear to everyone that these are two separate organizations. This statement is part of that effort.
