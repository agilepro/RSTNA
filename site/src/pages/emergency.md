Several of our members have graduated from the CERT basic training. A few more are in the process of getting certified. This is an ongoing process, and the more people in the community and neighborhood know how to prepare for and react in a disaster, the better. Michael Bryant coordinates and tracks our participants. 

If you are interested in emergency preparedness, please contact us at ranchostna@gmail.com. Attention of Michael Bryant.
