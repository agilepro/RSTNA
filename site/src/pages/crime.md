We started to form Neighborhood Watches for several streets within our Neighborhood Association. This is an ongoing process. Once Neighborhood Watches form, they receive signs from the city. Raul Lopez coordinates the Neighborhood Watches and has facilitated the SJPD meetings, preceding and following the establishment of those Watches. 

If you are interested in Crime Prevention and Neighborhood watches, please contact us at ranchostna@gmail.com. Attention of Raul Lopes.
