Currently our biggest community event is National Night Out. We participated in it last year and will do so again this year. It will most likely be located at the Club again. Joyce Collier is our liaison with the Club and has made several meetings of our association there in the past year possible. 

If you are interested in planning and facilitating community events, please contact us at ranchostna@gmail.com. Attention of Joyce Collier.
